[PhpHaml]

PhpHaml is a PHP library for working with HAML (and eventually SASS).

	<?php
	
	require 'library.php';
	
	phphaml\Library::autoload();
	
	$parser = new phphaml\haml\Parser("%hello world");
	echo $parser->render(); // <hello>world</hello>
	
	?>

[Library Structure]

The library was designed to be highly modular, as such there are 3 types of
component involved in parsing a document:

  - Parsers:
    Parsers are the most general component.  All they do, really, is traverse
    the source line-by-line, handle context switching (indentation) and then
    delegate the line to the appropriate Handler.
  
  - Handlers:
    Handlers perform the majority of the parsing.  They extract information from
    the source line and generate nodes in the AST.  As much processing as
    possible should be done in the handlers to minimise the processing that
    needs done by the AST.
  
  - Nodes:
    Unsurprisingly, Nodes are used as nodes in the abstract syntax tree.  They
    contain all the information, parsed by the Handlers, to render the document
    without any additional info from outside the AST, which allows the AST to be
    cached.
