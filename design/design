Problem:
	Design an implementable, highly extensible, flexible and extremely elegant parser for parsing 
	HAML / SASS documents, and ideally other indent-contexted, fairly context insensitive languages.

	How about:
		A parser autoloads its components, then checks each component's 'trigger' regular expression
		against the current line, and upon a match delegates the parsing of that line to the component.
		
		Problem:
			Elegantly dealing with priority... more specific triggers (e.g. tags) must come before less
			specific ones (e.g. text).
			
			How about:
				Somehow deciding on the specificity of the trigger expression, and sorting accordingly.
				
				Problem:
					No idea how to do it, if it's possible.  Likely process-intensive, although it would
					only need done once per 'load' (static property).
					
					How about:
						Instead of trigger regular expressions, use a more restricted expression, such as
						only checking the first character of the line or, in general, a substring at the
						beginning of the line.
						
						Problem:
							Inflexible, potentially inextensible.  Is this expressive enough for HAML / 
							SASS? If so, is it an acceptable limitation on future extension?
							
							How about:
								Beginning-of-line substring is expressive enough for HAML / SASS, and is an
								acceptable limitation.
			
			How about:
				Each component has a priority.
				
				Problem:
					Inflexible and inextensible, gaps would have to be left in priorities to allow 
					'insertion' of new components.
			
			How about:
				Manually specifying the order in the parser.
				
				Problem:
					Inflexible and inextensible, new components would have to be hard-coded into the parser,
					component name changes would have to be changed in the parser, etc.
